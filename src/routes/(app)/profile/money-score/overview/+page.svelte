<div class="overview">
  <p>If Bounce 10 is a journey, then MoneyScore is your map. We begin with an assessment not to think about where we should have gone in the past, but to direct what we want to visit in the future. We use MoneyScore to determine how comfortable your child is with different money topics (saving, spending, sharing, etc.). From this, we can measure progress moving forward. Weâ€™d like you to go over the assessment with your child or on behalf of your child. Be as honest as possible.</p>
  <p>MoneyScore consists of 50 questions total, five for each of the 10 Money Skills.</p>
