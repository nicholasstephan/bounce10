  <p>Our values dictate why we do what we do. Discussing values with children can create a whole new vocabulary to understand differences, find common ground, and understand what brings you together as a family.</p>
  <p>Like FISH, the values discussion is one that runs through everything in Bounce 10. The first discussion is simply a jumping off place and the beginning of a conversation that will become more rich over time. Throughout Bounce 10, these values and others will gradually be explored and defined.</p>
